# Nomster

This is the second project from [The Firehose Project](http://www.thefirehoseproject.com/).
It is a Yelp clone that integrates with the Google Map API and includes features like user comments, star ratings, image uploading, and user authentication.
A [working version](https://firehose-nomster-jim-lin.herokuapp.com/) is hosted on Heroku.
